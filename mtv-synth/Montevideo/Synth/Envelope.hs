-- | PITFALL: "on" should only take on the values 0 or 1.
-- | PITFALL: "on" is a little misleading, as when it switches from 1 to 0,
-- the envelope does not immediately end; rather, it begins to ramp down to 0.
-- | USAGE: When "on" becommes 1, the envelope swells from 0 to 1.
-- When it becomes 0, the envelope falls from 1 to 0.
-- The signals "att" and "rel" give the attack and release times.
--
-- An ADSR envelope would be more natural (and flexible) than the
-- following weird patch of two envelopes, but I couldn't figure ADSR out.
