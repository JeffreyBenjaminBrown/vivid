-- ^ If _skip = 1, then the grid vectors can be left Nothing;
-- the system will figure out what they should be.
-- But For Thanos tunings, the grid vectors must be manually defined.
-- The "vertical" vector indicates, given a pitch at (0,0),
-- the nearest enharmonic pitch is in a nearby columns.
-- The "horizontal" vector indicates, given a pitch at (0,0),
-- the nearest octave to that pitch in a nearby row.

-- Note that both vectors are rarely truly orthogonal to the axes.
